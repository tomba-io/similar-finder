# Development

Notes for maintainers of the Tomba Similar Finder Actor. The README is the end-user page shown on Apify Store.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- [Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli) for deployment

## Scripts

```bash
npm install
npm run build     # compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run lint      # ESLint (src and test)
npm run format    # Prettier
npm test          # unit + end-to-end tests (node:test)
npm start         # run locally with tsx
```

## Credentials

The Actor uses our Tomba account. Credentials come from environment variables, never from the input:

| Variable             | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `TOMBA_API_KEY`      | Tomba API key (`ta_…`)                             |
| `TOMBA_API_SECRET`   | Tomba secret (`ts_…`)                              |
| `TOMBA_API_ENDPOINT` | Optional API base URL; only used by the test suite |

`.actor/actor.json` maps the variables to Apify secrets:

```bash
apify secrets add tombaApiKey ta_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
apify secrets add tombaApiSecret ts_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
apify push
```

Run locally:

```bash
TOMBA_API_KEY=ta_… TOMBA_API_SECRET=ts_… npm start
```

## Pricing (pay per event)

In **Apify Console → Publication → Monetization**, choose **Pay per event** and add:

| Event           | Price    | Charged when                                  |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `tomba-request` | $0.00312 | Tomba returns a billable response (see below) |

One request per domain, so the price is $0.00312 per domain with results.

`isBillable()` in `src/tomba.ts` mirrors Tomba's billing:

| Tomba outcome                                          | Charged |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| JSON with non-empty `data`, including negative answers | Yes     |
| Error status (4xx, 5xx, including 422 and 429)         | No      |
| Success with empty or null `data`                      | No      |
| Success with an `errors` object                        | No      |
| Non-JSON body (reported as 502)                        | No      |
| Cache hit                                              | No      |

## Architecture

- `src/tomba.ts`: shared helper, identical in every Tomba Actor. It handles credentials, caching (`tomba-cache` key-value store), retries with exponential backoff, pay-per-event charging, budget reservation, the concurrency pool and resume state.
- `src/main.ts`: Actor-specific input handling and output mapping.
    - One `GET /similar?domain=` request per domain (normalized and deduplicated), run in parallel with `runPool`.
    - One dataset item per similar website: `input_domain`, `similar_domain`, `company_name`, `industries`, `website_url`, `source`, `charged`, `cached`. A domain without results gets one item with `similar_domain: null` and an `error`.
    - `maxResults` caps the total number of rows for the whole run; once reached the pool stops. A request that was already in flight when the cap was hit pushes nothing (it is not reported as "no results"); its response is cached, so a later run gets it for free.
- The `tomba` SDK v1.1.1 resolves every call to `{ data, rateLimit }`, where `data` is the response body. Its `.d.ts` types still declare the old return type, so always go through `callTomba()`.

## Tests

- `test/tomba.test.ts`: unit tests for the shared helper (identical in every Actor)
- `test/main.test.ts`: end-to-end tests that run `src/main.ts` against a local mock Tomba API
- `test/helpers.ts`: mock server and Actor runner (identical in every Actor)

Locally, the Apify SDK prices every event at $1 when `ACTOR_TEST_PAY_PER_EVENT=true`, so the tests use `maxTotalChargeUsd` as an event count.
